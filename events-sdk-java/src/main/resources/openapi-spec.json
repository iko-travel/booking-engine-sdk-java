{"openapi":"3.0.1","info":{"title":"Wink API","description":"## APIs\nNot every integrator needs every APIs. For that reason, we have separated APIs into context.\n\n- [Affiliate](https://api.wink.travel/docs?api=affiliate): All APIs related to selling travel inventory as an affiliate.\n- [Extranet](https://api.wink.travel/docs?api=extranet): All APIs related to managing travel inventory and suppliers.\n- [Booking Engine](https://api.wink.travel/docs?api=booking-engine): All APIs related to searching for travel inventory and creating bookings.\n- [Channel Manager](/docs?api=channel-manager): All APIs related to channel managers who want to integrate with our platform.\n- [Events](/docs?api=events): All APIs related to Integration events.\n\n## SDKs\nWe are actively working on supporting the most used languages out there. If you don't see your language here, reach out to us with a request to officially add your language. In the meantime, if you want to roll your own SDK, you can do so by downloading the OpenAPI spec and using one of the many available OpenAPI generators available: [https://openapi-generator.tech/docs/generators](https://openapi-generator.tech/docs/generators).\n\n- Java SDK [https://github.com/wink-travel/wink-sdk-java](https://github.com/wink-travel/wink-sdk-java)\n\n## Usage\nThese features are made available to you via a [REST API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer). This API is language agnostic.\n\n## Versioning\nWe chose to version our endpoints in a way that we hope affects your integration with us the least. You request the version of our API you wish to work with via the `Accept` header and by using our custom JSON mime type. When it's time for you to upgrade, you only have to change the version number to get access to our updated endpoints. You can also choose to always work with the latest major version release by accepting application/json. We recommend the former. Example: application/vnd.payment-v`1`+json.\n\n## Release history\n- 2022-06-28: v1 - Externalized channel manager API into its own API\n- 2022-05-08: v1 - Exposed channel manager API\n- 2021-07-01: v1 - Initial release\n\n\n# Events API\nThese are admin-only endpoints that are used to uni-directionally communicate bookings emanating from the Inventory app. Once received, the booking will get forwarded to the correct channel manager.\n\n# Intended Audience\nThis document is intended for Wink developers who wish to understand our event system.\n\n# Requirements\n- Valid Oauth2 token with admin-level scope.","contact":{"name":"Bjorn Harvold","email":"bjorn@wink.travel"},"version":"20.3.4-SNAPSHOT","x-logo":{"backgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","altText":"wink","url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/traveliko/image/upload/c_scale,h_129/v1653285543/wink/logo_text_white.svg"}},"servers":[{"url":"https://dev.traveliko.com:8445"}],"paths":{},"components":{"schemas":{},"securitySchemes":{"oauth2_client_credentials":{"type":"oauth2","description":"## Retrieve access token\nMake a POST (`Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded`) request to the Token URL below.
